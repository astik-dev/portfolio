            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. They help us improve your browsing experience and gather information about how our website is being used. <a href="https://astik.dev/">astik.dev</a> uses cookies to implement Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager.</p>

            <h4>Google Analytics 4</h4>
            <p>We use Google Analytics 4 to analyze the usage of our website and better understand how visitors interact with it. Google Analytics 4 gathers information such as the pages you visit, the time you spend on each page, and the actions you take.
